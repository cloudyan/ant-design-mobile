# What are experimental components?

Experimental components are components that are still in the exploratory stage. We will release them publicly in advance, so that developers can try them out. Feedback and suggestions are also welcome.

In future minor and major versions, these experimental components may change their functionality, break changes in the API, or even be completely removed, so please be sure to subscribe to our [release log](https://github.com/ant-design/ant-design-mobile/releases).

Please note that, despite them being experimental components, they should not contain bugs. We will still maintain strict quality control for them, although we may be, in some instances, uncertain about their usage scenarios.
