# Quick Start

## Installation

```bash
$ npm install --save antd-mobile@next
# or
$ yarn add antd-mobile@next
```

<Alert> During the beta phase we may release break changes in subsequent releases, so it is highly recommended to lock the version of antd-mobile with lockfiles or manually.</Alert>

## Import

Just import the component directly and antd-mobile will automatically load css style files:

```js
import { Button } from 'antd-mobile'
```

If you are developing an internal project in alibaba group or ant group, please read [this additional guide](https://yuque.antfin.com/antd-mobile/kfcgs3/md4or5).

## Playground

If you don't want to configure your environment locally, you can also try it directly on [codesandbox](https://codesandbox.io/s/antd-mobile-snrxr?file=/package.json).
