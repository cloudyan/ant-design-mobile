## Loading

In order to maintain compatibility with older versions of usage, we keep the reference to Loading, so if you continue to use Loading, there is still no problem. However, since we are likely to remove the Loading reference in future major version upgrades, if you see this prompt, please replace Loading in the project with DotLoading as soon as possible.
